# School_District_Analysis
# Overview
In this repository, I was tasked with performing specific analysis on the school district data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The school district data is data gathered from fifteenth schools which includes their budget, type of school, size, and much more information. Throughout my analysis I manipulated the data in ways so I could perfrom specific analysis. In my respository my goal was to compare the academic performance of the school district based on a single factor. In my first analysis all data from every school was used to reach my result. In my second analysis the ninth grade reading and math data from Thomas High School was removed due to the possiblilty of that data being tainted. The removed data was replaced with NaN. Below I will provide a descriptive analysis of my data.

# Results
District Summary

When looking at this data a very slight noticeable change has occured between the two data results. In my first analysis you can see that the passing math and reading percentage were slightly higher then the results on stemming from the second analysis. In District Summary 1, the passing percentages were %75 and %85.8. The ooverall passing percentage was also higher which came in at %65.2. In District Summary 2, the passing percentages were %74.8 and %85.7 respectively. The overall passing percentage was %64.9. Although removing the ninth grade data from Thomas High School didn't cause a high difference a conclusion can be made that the data from Thomas High School ninth graders boosted the percentages in reading and math.
