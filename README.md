# School_District_Analysis
# Overview
In this repository, I was tasked with performing specific analysis on the school district data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The school district data is data gathered from fifteenth schools which includes their budget, type of school, size, and much more information. Throughout my analysis I manipulated the data in ways to so I could perfrom specific analysis. In my respository my goal was to compare the academic performance of the school district based on a single factor. In my first analysis all data from every school was used to reach my result. In my second analysis the ninth grade data from Thomas High School was removed due to the possiblilty of that data being tainted. Below I will provide a descriptive analysis of my data.
